Hi Esraa, Also — you should start thinking about a “functional” dimension for surrogate classification / taxonomy. What are surrogates used for in science & engineering.

Also fleshing out further details on (i) Machine Learning Models and (ii) Architecture will be useful.

Third recommendation would be to see if there is a way to quantify the data volumes used to train the surrogates; another dimension worth investigating is whether this data is “offline” or “online” e.g., data is generated by “active” simulations or another “live” experiments
